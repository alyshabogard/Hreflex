# Constructing H-reflex and M-wave Recruitment Curves of the Soleus Muscle
# Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) Protocol
We stimulate the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) in the popliteal fossa to evoke a resting soleus h-reflex and m-wave by using a handle cathode electrode. We increment stimulus intensities to obtain hmax and mmax. Then, 3 more trials are conducted at the same incrementing stimulus intensities. Our data is collected using the Signal software and saved as an Excel file with the following columns: intensity_ma,	m_frame,	m_mv,	h_frame,	h_mv,	m_frame2,	m_mv2,	h_frame2,	h_mv2,	m_frame3,	m_mv3,	h_frame3,	h_mv3,	m_frame4,	m_mv4,	h_frame4, and	h_mv4.

intensity_ma = stores the PNS intensity in mA
m_frame = stores the frame captured in Signal (increments 1:nth stimulations). This is the same number as the h_frame. We plot both the m-wave and h-wave live, therefore, both frames are stored even though it is redundant. 
m_mv = stores the peak-to-peak m-wave amplitude in mV
h_frame = stores the frame captured in Signal (increments 1:nth stimulations). This is the same number as the m_frame. We plot both the m-wave and h-wave live, therefore, both frames are stored even though it is redundant. 
h_mv = stores the peak-to-peak m-wave amplitude in mV
